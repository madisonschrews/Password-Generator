# Password-Generator

This is a web application to generate a random password, made up of numbers, letters (capitalized and un-capitalized), and symbols supported by the web browser. 

There is a slider option to adjust the character complexity of the password by length. The length is indicated below the two buttons.

There are two buttons â€” one button is to generate the password, and the second button is to copy the password to the clipboard. 

note: I forgot to print the array to the console, and I would if I had a bit more time to play around with this application. i would also adjust the UI a bit to make the buttons
more centered and the slider feature a bit bigger.
